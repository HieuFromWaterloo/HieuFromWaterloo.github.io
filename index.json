Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"Overview LDA is one of the most important topic models in practice. On a high level, it provides a generative model that describes how the documents in a dataset are generated; i.e. how words are sampled from multiple topics to construct a document. This generative process follows a bag of words (BOW) assumption. Hence, the order in which the word occurs is not taken into account. The core of topic modeling is to analyze unlabeled text data, discover the unknown number of topics and topic distribution in a unsupervised way. This is achieved by making use of statistical inference.\nReferences This note is written based primarily on the following sources:\n D. Blei, Andrew Ng, Jordan M. Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

The Canadian industry, long dominated by \u0026ldquo;the Big Five\u0026rdquo; (RBC, CIBC, BMO, TD, and Scotia), is facing increasing competition with international banks and novel technologies such as robo-advisors. This shift is compounded by socioeconomic phenomenon including the foreboding of a North American recession and the global resurgence of populism. Hence, more than ever, financial institutions must identify ways to recruit and retain a loyal customer base. Targeted phone-based campaigns have long been useful tools to this end. In this project, we aim to discover the attributes of a successful telephone-based marketing campaign promoting financial services. In particular, we are interested in identifying the characteristics of clients who have subscribed to a term deposit with a bank after being contacted by a customer engagement representative. We will be utilizing campaign led by a Portuguese bank between 2008 and 2010 to fit a variety of classification models.\n","date":1575072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575072000,"objectID":"5c1ab5de8ce903430b092ab2c2b1517c","permalink":"https://HieuFromWaterloo.github.io/post/stat441/","publishdate":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/stat441/","section":"post","summary":"Statistical Learning - Advanced Classification Final Project","tags":["Statistical Learning"],"title":"Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hieu Q.

First, we need to apply Machine Learning to effectively analyze, forecast and detect anomalies in stock trends in Canadian financial markets. Second, we need to deploy Natural Language Processing methodologies on financial news and earning calls to successfully pick up the key indicators that lead to a capital intensive activities (mergers and acquisitions, strategic expansion, debt maturities due, etc.). Lastly, we need to incorporate the output from the previous two objectives along with other relevant factors and train an algorithm to detect potential capital funding opportunities in an unsupervised fashion.\nNote: due to confidential reasons, materials for this project is reserved\n","date":1567123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567123200,"objectID":"c8fcbb10349e482d2ec7850df3703338","permalink":"https://HieuFromWaterloo.github.io/post/gib/","publishdate":"2019-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gib/","section":"post","summary":"Deep Learning \u0026 NLP applications in Global Investment Banking","tags":["Statistical Learning","Deep Learning"],"title":"Detect Potential Financing Deals in Capital Markets","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hieu Q.
